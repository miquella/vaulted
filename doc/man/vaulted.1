.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-\fR may be used to differentiate the \fICMD\fP from \fB\fCvaulted\fR\&'s own arguments.

.SH GUI Password Prompts
.PP
Although Vaulted tries to make sure you can redirect \fB\fCstdin\fR and friends,
sometimes it is still preferable to use a GUI\-based password prompt. For this
reason, Vaulted can be configured to use an askpass implementation. Vaulted's
askpass integration is triggered when the \fB\fCVAULTED_ASKPASS\fR variable is set.
.PP
Pointing \fB\fCVAULTED_ASKPASS\fR to an executable file that implements askpass will
cause Vaulted to use execute the file specified to prompt the user for
passwords. The first parameter provided to the executable is prompt text
intended to be shown to the user. The askpass implementation then writes the
password to \fB\fCstdout\fR and returns a success code (0). If a failure code (non\-0)
is returned, the password input is aborted.
.PP
Vaulted is intended to integrate seamlessly with existing askpass
implementations (e.g. \fB\fCssh\-askpass\fR).
.PP
On macOS, a simple AppleScript askpass implementation can be used:
.PP
.RS
.nf
#!/usr/bin/env osascript

on run argv
    if length of argv > 0 then
        set message to item 1 of argv
    else

    end if

    set frontmost_application to name of (info for (path to frontmost application))
    tell application frontmost_application
        display dialog message with title "Vaulted" with icon caution with hidden answer default answer ""

        text returned of result
    end tell
end run
