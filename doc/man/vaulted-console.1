.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Opens the AWS console in the default web browser. It will use the credentials
in the current environment unless a vault is specified, in which case it will
use the credentials in the vault.
.PP
The session length will either use the passed in duration, the provided vault's
duration, or defaults to 1 hour in that order of preference. Durations must be
at least 15 minutes and less than 12 hours.
.PP
This requires that you have the sts:GetFederationToken or sts:AssumeRole
permissions enabled for your user.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\fC\-\-assume\fR \fIarn\fP
Specifies the full ARN of the role to assume. See \fBASSUMING A ROLE\fP below
for details on how Vaulted assumes roles.
.IP
Role assumption may be performed without specifying a vault to spawn from.
When invoked this way, credentials are sourced from default locations (e.g.
environment, configuration files, instance profile, etc.).
.PP
\fB\fC\-\-duration\fR \fIduration\fP
    Specifies the duration that the console session is valid. The duration must
    be within the range 15m\-12h.
.SH ASSUMING A ROLE
.PP
A role to assume can be specified either in a vault's configuration (via
\fB\fCvaulted edit\fR) or specified via the \fB\fC\-\-assume\fR option.
.PP
Vaulted first opens the specified vault to retrieve the appropriate credentials.
If a role is specified in the vault's configuration it will use that unless a
role is explicitly passed in through the \fB\fC\-\-assume\fR option.
