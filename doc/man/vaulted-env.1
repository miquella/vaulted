.SH NAME
.PP
vaulted env \- outputs shell commands that load secrets for a vault into the shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB\fCvaulted env\fR \fIname\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP]
.br
\fB\fCvaulted env \-\-assume\fR \fIarn\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Creates an environment using variables and the AWS key stored in the vault. The
resulting environment variables are used to generate shell commands that will
load the secrets into a shell.
.PP
The shell is autodetected from the \fB\fCSHELL\fR environment variable, if the shell
is unknown or unspecified, \fB\fCsh\fR compatible commands are emitted.
.PP
\fINote:\fP SSH keys are ignored when generating environments this way. This is due
to the inability to track the lifetime of the environment, which means the SSH
agent would exist indefinitely.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\fC\-\-assume\fR \fIarn\fP
Specifies the full ARN of the role to assume. The role is assumed after
spawning the session for the vault. While the spawned session for the vault
is valid for the duration specified in the vault, the credentials resulting
from the assume role are valid for a maximum of one hour.
.IP
Role assumption may be performed without specifying a vault to spawn from.
When invoked this way, credentials are sourced from default locations (e.g.
environment, configuration files, instance profile, etc.).
.TP
\fB\fC\-\-format\fR <shell,fish,sh,json,\fIcustom\fP>
Specify what format to use, defaults to \fB\fCshell\fR which will autodetect which
shell format to emit.
.IP
\fB\fCfish\fR, and \fB\fCsh\fR will emit output suitable for evaluation into the specified
shell. \fB\fCjson\fR will emit the map of values to be set in a format useful in
other programming environments, this will not include the array of variables
to be removed.
.IP
If the format string supplied does not match one of the pre\-defined formats
it will be interpreted as a text template using golang's built\-in
\fB\fCtext/template\fR package. The user template will be supplied a struct with the
fields outlined below. Also available are a \fB\fCreplace\fR function for gsub like
behavior and a \fB\fCjson\fR function which accepts a value and emits a pretty
printed JSON string.
.IP
To receive just the names of the variables to remove formatted as JSON the
custom template would be: \fB\fC{{ json .Unset }}\fR
